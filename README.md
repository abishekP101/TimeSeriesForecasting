## Overview

Time series forecasting is crucial for decision-making in many industries. This repository demonstrates a variety of forecasting techniques, from classical statistical models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Each method includes well-documented code, example datasets, and evaluation metrics for easy comparison.

## Statistical Methods

### ARIMA
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a powerful statistical model that captures standard temporal structures in time series data.

### SARIMA
Seasonal ARIMA extends ARIMA by modeling seasonal effects and periodic fluctuations.

### Exponential Smoothing
Methods like Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing account for trends and seasonality in a simple, recursive fashion.

### Prophet
An open-source tool by Facebook for forecasting time series data with trend and seasonality, robust to missing data and outliers.

## Deep Learning Methods

### LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory networks are designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### GRU
Gated Recurrent Units, similar to LSTMs but with a simpler structure, often provide competitive performance.

### CNN for Time Series
1D Convolutional Neural Networks can extract features and patterns from time series windows.

### Transformer-based Models
Attention-based models like Transformers have shown strong performance in capturing global dependencies in time series data.
